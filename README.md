Prototype of a catching objects game

Link for trying the game: [Game prototype](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/counter-prototype-build) 

GAME RULES:
Catch colored pieces with the matching containers (move with W & D keys).
Scoring rules:
- Matching piece & container color = 3 points
- If the caught piece comes out of the container, the 3 points are deducted (you can re-catch them and get the points back)
- Incorrectly matched colors deduct 1 point (if you toss them out of your container you get the lost point back)
- Pieces hitting the floor just bounce, you can still catch them, and they don't influence the score
